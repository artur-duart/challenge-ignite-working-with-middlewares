# Challenge 02: Working with middlewares

This is my repository for Rocketseat Challenge 02, where I'm working with middlewares.

## About the challenge

In this challenge I'll work with the same application as in the previous challenge: an application to manage tasks (or *todos*) but with some changes.

It will be allowed to create a user with `name` and username, as well as to CRUD *todos*:

- Create a new *todo*;
- List all *todos*;
- Change the `title` and `deadline` of an existing *todo*;
- Mark a *todo* as done;
- Delete a *todo*;

All this for each specific user. In addition, this time I'll add a free plan where the user can only create up to ten *todos* and a Pro plan that will allow you to create unlimited *todos*, all using middlewares to carry out the necessary validations.
